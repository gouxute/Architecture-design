# RMMV
Architecture Design Software's source code <br>
Developed with C++, OpenGL, Qt, RMMV is an environmental analysis tool that allows architecture designers to simulate building performance from the earliest stages of conceptual design. It combines analysis functions with an interactive display that presents analytical results like illumination situation directly within the structure of the building model.
##Functions:
 1.Draw 3D buildings.<br>
